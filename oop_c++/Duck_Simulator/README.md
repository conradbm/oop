<h2> The Duck Simulator </h2>

<p> This duck simulator is a good small reproducible example that shows how to use the Strategy Design Pattern </p>

<p> A couple cool things I got from this little simulator were </p>
<ul> 
<li>Understanding how to write an abstract class and inherit properties</li>
<li>Understanding how to correctly use the virtual function as a placeholder for subclasses to override </li>
<li>Understanding how to create an virtual interface class and create subclasses that use it uniquely </li>
<li>Understanding how to use subclasses of interfaces as properties to subclasses of the Duckclass in such a way that we allow for our differnt 'Duck' type objects being created to have unique behaviors in a structured and dynamic way.</li>
</ul>
